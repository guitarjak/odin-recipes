Hi! This is my first project on GitHub, I'm following along the guide of "The Odin Project"
Very excited what will I learn and what I will able to do after finishing this course
Oh, btw, you can checkout my blog here -> https://www.jakkrapat.com
I document all my learning journey and the things I learned along my working and daily life here.

Things I want to do after finishing this course
1. Build a project from my ideas or problem that I faced. 
    Ex. A site that host a memory for the school kids
        A guide or handbook that will hold your hands through a journey if you want to learn sth
        A app that can monitor a price of certain product and notify users when the price changed
        The application that helps people find a room in foriegn country (i couldn't find a good room at UON)
        The application that helps practice learning new word (free app)
        The application that allows to upvote our collegues when they did a good job!
2. Start to monitize my application to get atleast 1k MRR
3. Scale it to 10k MRR
4. Live the life I want
